        <h2>Start of Something New</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Saturday, December 7th 2019</h6>

        <p>Hello. My name is <u>Afkar Sukmawan Ahmad</u>. My <strong>dream</strong> is to become a <em>game maker</em>
            and a <em>web developer</em>, so that people enjoy game that hopefully I will make. I started my study to
            become a programmer at Khan Academy. At first, I only studied Math in Khan Academy. <strong>But then I see
                something interesting</strong>, which is <em>Computer Programming</em>. <em>Sunday, May 5th 2019</em>,
            the day I start my journey to become a programmer. I like to play games, so it will be cool if I can
            <strong>make</strong> the games, not just <strong>play</strong> the games. <em>And so, I clicked my first
                ever-video of learning to become a great programmer</em>. Starting with JavaScript, I climb my way to
            future that waits me there.</p>

        <h2>My First Ever JavaScript Game</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Monday, December 9th 2019</h6>
        <p>After some time of studying JavaScript, I'm excited to make a game. Because I'm not really a <em>pro</em> at
            JavaScript yet, I'm trying to make a simple game. It took a long time to think what kind of game that I want
            to make. But then I remember my favorite game, which is <strong>Pokemon</strong>, so I start to make a
            simple <em>dodge game</em>, but the character is Pokemon. I called it, "<strong>Pokemon Fly</strong>". After
            some <em>trial and error</em>, I finally made it, but, it's only one character, which is
            <strong>Mudkip</strong>, <em>my favorite Pokemon</em>. You can check it if you want. <a
                href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/pokemon-fly-1-0/5432642201026560">Click here to
                play my game</a>. It's still a work in progress. The next project is to create Level 2, with Charmander.
            So, I guess that's it for this post. Byeee..!!</p>
